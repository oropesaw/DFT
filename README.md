# DFT

The main objective of this repository is to study the adsorption of carbon monoxide (CO) on the metal surface Au (111). To carry out this study it is required that you have the ```quantum-espresso``` and ```xcrysden``` packages installed. In addition, basic knowledge about ```ab-initio``` calculations is necessary.

## Convergence parameters
in the CC folder we can find different metals with a structure face-centered cubic (fcc). We analyze here how is the convergence with the cutting potential ```ecutwfc``` and the numbert of k-point.
